# Gemini Profile Glazer (Readme's written by Gemini, pls bare with me)
=======

Welcome to **Gemini Profile Glazer**—a little POC I made to Sell a profile (mine) to people.
---

## What’s the Deal? 🤔

- **AI powered glazing**: I’m using the Gemini API to make a profile look like a million bucks.

---

## Tech Stuff 🛠️

- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **AI Sauce**: Powered by Gemini API (AI studio has a lot of exp models)
- **Styling**: Just some casual CSS.

## Gemini API Key 🔑

The bot needs its brain (aka the API key):
1. Grab a Gemini API key (ask Google Generative AI or wherever you signed up).
2. Toss it into a `.env` file:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```
3. Done. Now it’s ready to flex.
